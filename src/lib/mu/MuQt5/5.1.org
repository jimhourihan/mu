* HACKS
** QMargins couldn't link operator+= and operator-=
** added QtCore into include path for QtSensor header files

* TASKS
** TODO QFileDevice implement permissions() function manually or fix
    It returns QFileDevice::Permissions template type -- need to have
    it return int or something translatable.


* GENERAL ISSUES
** QMethod could be wrapped now 

* Qt 5.1 BUGS
** QtCore QMargins is missing implementation of operators += and -=
** link messages for RVX 
    ld: warning: direct access in QFormInternal::QAbstractFormBuilder::saveItemViewExtraInfo(QAbstractItemView const*, QFormInternal::DomWidget*, QFormInternal::DomWidget*) to global weak symbol QStringList::~QStringList() means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings.
