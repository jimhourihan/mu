#
#   SYNTAX
#   ------
#
#   * Each line is a parameter assignment
#     or a comment or blank
#
#   * A '#' on a line starts a comment and goes
#     until the end of the line
#
#   * lines are of the form: PARAM ARG = VALUE(S)
#     the ARG part is only needed for some
#     parameters
#
#   * some parameters have an extra argument
#     like "angle" or "actor"
#
#   * some parameters take three values ("target")
#
#   * some parameters are boolean (yes, true, 1)

#   Some basic parameters
#
# Note: Boolean paramters can be "yes", "true", or "1" for true, anything
#       else for false.
#
# New selection method !!
# selection method: random or linear, 
# defaults to random (the old way), so far linear yields fewer twins
# selection method: use linear
#
########################
#
#   a note about the seeds: First change the "emitSeed" number 
#   (by one at a time is OK) to get a new random position
#   and sprite choice. If you like the physical distribution, 
#   stop changing "emitSeed". If you still need to try different
#   random sprite distributions without changing how they are layed 
#   out, change just the "seed". emitSeed will change the random seed 
#   used to place the particles and which sprite gets put at each 
#   particle position, seed will change which sprite gets put at 
#   each particle
