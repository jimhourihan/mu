#   Run a shell command on each library in build order
#   you can run a program like this: 
#
#       run arg1 arg2 arg3
#
#   in which case run execs the project target with the arguments or
#   you can do this: 
#
#       run :PROGRAM arg1 arg2 arg3
#
#   in which case run execs PROGRAM with the arguments.
# 
#   Run checks the current directory to discover the project files,
#   unless "--p <dir>" is the first pair of args, in which case run
#   looks in <dir>.
