Files of the form:

    Makefile.PLATFORM.ARCH.COMPILER

are called "platform" makefiles in Makefile.master. These generally contain
the bulk of the platform dependent information.

Files of the form:

    Makefile.PLATFORM.ARCH.COMPILER.TYPE

where TYPE is the contents of the BUILD_TYPE variable are included after
the platform makefile and can override rules/variables. Typically this is
just the OPTFLAGS and various related variables. These are called "target"
makefiles in Makefile.master.

The $BUILD_ROOT/build/Makefile.build file is also sourced, but typically
only holds the values of PLATFORM, ARCH, COMPILER, and BUILD_TYPE. However,
it is possible to further override variables in that file.
