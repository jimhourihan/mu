 This is the Mu extension language. The project was started in the early
 90s and has been reworked a number of times. The syntax was overhauled in
 2001. Its primary purpose has been as an extension language for larger
 applications written in C++.

 If you're looking for an example of how to write a language you're
 probably better off looking elsewhere.

 Mu is still in use (at VFX studios as one of RV's extension languages
 (along with python). Other apps which have used it:

    * RV     -- review tool (tweaksoftware.com)
    * C4     -- particle, rigid body, fluids package (tweakfilms). 
    * crack  -- procedural geometry shattering, cracking (tweakfilms)
    * procedural geometry plugins for prman, entropy, and gelato (tweakfilms)

 Interesting features:

    * BSD license
    * Full compile time type checking
    * local type inference
    * Partial application and partial evaluation
    * Sum, product, record, and OO-class types
    * "Varying" data types for use as CPU shading language
    * Python like namespaces and module system
    * Qt bindings generated from Qt html docs
    * Primitive and reference types (Java-like)
    * Primitive unicode support

 Badness:

    * Lots of ancient to old C++ -- (all the way back to cfront)
    * nil
    * C++-like OO syntax is bolted on
